## Logging in to your instance

Google Cloud comes with a browser based SSH application, which you can launch via `gce_ssh_browser` to set it up further to your liking.

```r
library(googleComputeEngineR)
gce_ssh_browser("my-server")
```

## SSH commands

You can also send ssh commands to your running instance from R via the `gce_ssh()` commands.

For this you will need to either connect first via the `gcloud compute ssh` command that generates SSH-keys, or generate them yourself following this [Google guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance).

Once you have generated for your username, the public and private key, you can connect via:

```r
library(googleComputeEngineR)

vm <- gce_vm("my-instance")

## add SSH info to the VM object
vm <- gce_ssh_addkeys(username = "mark", 
                      instance = "your-instance", 
                      key.pub = "filepath.to.public.key",
                      key.private = "filepath.to.private.key")
  
## run command on instance            
gce_ssh(vm, "echo foo")
# foo
```

You can also call `gce_ssh` directly which will call `gce_ssh_addkeys` if it has not been run already.  It will look for a username via `Sys.info()[["user"]]` or you will need to specify it in the first call you make.

## Docker commands

For docker containers, the `docker_cmd` functions run the shell commands within a docker container.  These commands are derived from [`harbor`](https://github.com/wch/harbor), which you may want to use for its other features.  With harbor, you can also develop your docker container locally first using BootToDocker or similar before pushing it up.

A demo using speaking to a docker container is below:

```R
library(googleComputeEngineR)

# Create a virtual machine on Google Compute Engine
ghost <-   gce_vm("demo", 
                  image_project = "google-containers",
                  image_family = "gci-stable",
                  predefined_type = "f1-micro")

ghost

# Create and run a container in the virtual machine.

# This might take a while.

# Destroy the virtual machine from Google Compute Engine
gce_vm_delete(ghost)
```

To run R commands within a docker image in the cloud:

```r
library(googleComputeEngineR)

## make instance using R-base
vm <- gce_vm(template = "r-base", name = "rbase")

## add SSH info to the VM object
vm <- gce_ssh_addkeys(username = "mark", 
                      instance = "your-instance", 
                      key.pub = "filepath.to.public.key",
                      key.private = "filepath.to.private.key")

## run an R function on the instance within the R-base docker image
docker_run(vm, "rocker/r-base", c("Rscript", "-e", "1+1"))
#> [1] 2

gce_vm_delete(vm)
#> ==Operation delete :  PENDING
#> Started:  2016-10-07 02:37:14

gce_check_zone_op(.Last.value)
#> Operation complete in 33 secs 
#> ==Operation delete :  DONE
#> Started:  2016-10-07 02:37:14
#> Ended: 2016-10-07 02:37:47 
#> Operation complete in 33 secs 
```

Using `harbor` you can see other metadata about your container from your local R:

```r
library(googleComputeEngineR)
library(harbor)

vm <- gce_vm(template = "rstudio", 
             username = "mark", 
             password = "mark1234", 
             predefined_type = "f1-micro")
                                         
## get running rstudio container
cont <- containers(vm)
names(cont)
"rstudio"

## see if its running
container_running(con$rstudio)
[1] TRUE

## get logs from container
container_logs(con$rstudio)

## get metadata
container_update_info(con$rstudio)
<container>

  Disks:

```

## Using private Google Containers

Google Cloud comes with a [private container registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/) that is available to all VMs created in the that project, where you can store docker containers.

You can use this to save the state of the container VMs so you can redeploy them to other instances quickly, without needing to set them up again with packages or code.

Make your changes to the instance by logging in to the RStudio server at the IP provided, then this command will save  it to the local registry under the name you specify.  

This can take some time (5mins +) if its a new container. You should be able to see the image in the web UI when it is done at `https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/images/list`.
 
```r
gce_save_container(vm, "my-rstudio")
```

The container `my-rstudio` with your changes is now saved, and can be used to launch new containers.

To load onto another VM, use a Google container optimised instance with `image_project = "google-containers"`:

```r
vm2 <-  gce_vm(name = "new_instance",
               predefined_type = "f1-micro",
               image_family = "gci-stable",
               image_project = "google-containers")

## load and run the container from previous setup
gce_load_container(vm2, "my-rstudio")

```

## Futures

You can run R functions asynchronously over a cluster of Google VMs using the R package [`future`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=future).

Consult the [future readme](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future) for further details, but a quick demo is shown below:

```r
library(future)
library(googleComputeEngineR)

vm1 <- gce_vm("cluster1", template = "r-base")
vm2 <- gce_vm("cluster2", template = "r-base")
vm3 <- gce_vm("cluster2", template = "r-base")

vms <- list(vm1, vm2, vm3)
cl <- lapply(vms, FUN = as.cluster)
plan(cluster, workers = cl)

## use futures %<-% to send a function to the cluster
si %<-% Sys.info()
print(si)

## tidy up
lapply(vms, FUN = gce_vm_stop)
```

The package includes the function `gce_future_install_packages` which will load libraries onto your cluster and commit the r-base docker container they are running on.  

You can then save these containers to the Google Container registry as detailed via `gce_save_container`, for loading and use later for your asynchronous projects.
